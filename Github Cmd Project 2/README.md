                                                     GIT PROJECT

# Introduction
   Git is a powerful, open-source version control system that has become an essential tool in the software development industry. Initially developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, Git was designed to address the need for efficient source code management in large collaborative projects. Over time, it has gained widespread adoption and is now utilized by a vast number of software companies and individual developers alike..
# Requirements:
   To effectively utilize Git for Source Version Control (SVC) and Source Versioning System (SVS) operations, several key requirements should be considered:

# GIT Installtion Setps

Git Installation: Ensure that Git is installed on your development environment. Git provides official downloads and installation instructions for various operating systems on its website (https://git-scm.com/).

  * Open a new folder
  * Open terminal (Shortcut Ctrl + ~ )
  * Run a command Git clone "git clone copy url link"
  * System will verify github login popup

  * Packets will download to local repository.

**Repository Hosting:** Decide where you'll host your Git repositories. Popular options include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and self-hosted solutions. Choose a hosting platform that aligns with your project's security, collaboration, and accessibility needs.

**Collaboration Workflow:** Define a Git workflow that suits your team's needs. Common workflows include Gitflow, GitHub Flow, and GitLab Flow. Understanding and implementing a workflow ensures smooth collaboration and code management.

**Integration:** Consider integrating Git with other development tools, such as continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, issue tracking systems, and code review platforms, to streamline your development workflow.

**Backup and Recovery:** Implement regular backup and recovery procedures for your Git repositories. This ensures that you can recover your code in case of accidental data loss or corruption.
